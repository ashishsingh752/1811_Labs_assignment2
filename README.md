# CreateNewVideo Website README

## Introduction

Welcome to our CreateNewVideo website, I created this website for a online client . This README provides an overview of the website's features, technologies used, and instructions for accessing and navigating the platform.

## Technologies Used

This website is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.
- **Typescript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.
- **Supabase**: Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative, providing backend services such as authentication, databases, and storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-defined utility classes.

## Main Features

### 1. Login and Sign-up with Google Authentication

Our platform offers seamless login and sign-up experiences through Google Authentication. Users can quickly access the website using their Google accounts.

### 2. Email Verification

For users who prefer to sign up manually with an email other than Gmail, we provide email verification. Upon signing up, users receive a verification link in their email to confirm their account.

### 3. User and Notification Dropdown

We offer user and notification dropdown menus for easy access to user-related actions and notifications. Users can access their account settings, profile information, and receive notifications conveniently from these dropdowns.

### 4. Secure Redirects

To enhance security and user experience, signed-in users are automatically redirected from the sign-in/login page to their dashboard. This ensures that authenticated users directly access their personalized content without encountering redundant login screens.
